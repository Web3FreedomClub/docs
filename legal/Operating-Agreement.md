# Web3 Freedom Club DAO
A web3 club (community) for freedom fighters.

We believe that financial freedom is one of the most important freedoms to obtain in the 21st century but almost no one has it.  There will be (2) tools we use to help our club members on their journey towards financial freedom ‚Ä¶ [1] investment clubs and [2] mastermind groups.

# Mission

1. Create and #BUIDL a DAO ecosystem that allows people to autonomously foster and deliver win / win / win projects (@3winDAO / Triple Win Foundation).
2. Utilize Web3 tools and technology to bring community ownership with assets that are increasingly out of reach such as real estate (home and land ownership).

# Founding Principles
* Community Owned and Operated
* Full & Radical Transparency
* Best Practices: Find, Implement, and Refine
* We will be intentional about developing win / win / win projects

# Web3 Freedom Club DAO | Seasons

A season is an agreed upon window of time when members can align on projects that help us in achieving our broader mission.
